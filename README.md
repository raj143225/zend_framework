##File Storage:

  * An extra volume added to store resource files.
  * Create a soft link of proper partition(for ex: /mnt/volume-1/resource_s1) into project/public.
  * Create a directory "account" inside resource and grant proper permission.


##Server Setting:

  *Need to remove rewrite rule from virtualhost setup file (/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/...) and put it in .htaccess file.
  *Note that .htaccess is already added in the server.
